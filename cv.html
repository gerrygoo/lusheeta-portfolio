        <h3>MI CURRÍCULUM</h3>
        <p>
          Your letters wait at home In their bright red coats Under a midnight
          storm I hear four words you wrote "I can't be sad" Sad, sad, sad I
          can't make you mine Now you're on your own Even they can't stand But I
          said before And you know that I can't take my eyes Eyes, eyes, eyes
          off you And I bathed in the light you gave But it's dark in another
          way Yes, you gave me the light today But it's dark in another way And
          I bathed in the light you gave But it's dark in another way Yes, you
          gave me the light today But it's dark, it's dark, it's dark
